# Introduction #

The Interface is designed to provide not only Manual Control of the Vehicle but also to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Autonomous Control of the Vehicle as well, using satellite images available from Google Earth.

Manual Control of the Vehicle is provided by either a Keyboard or an attached and appropriately configured XBox-360 Controller.

All the following files can be found on either the SVN Repository or through Google Doc's.
