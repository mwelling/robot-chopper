# Introduction #

The Vehicle will be an Autonomous Quad-Rotor Tilt-Capable Co-Axial Helicopter. The original version of the Vehicle, version 1.0, was based on the DraganFlyer IV model with carbon fiber reinforcements and parts fabricated to work with the existing frame.  Version 2.0 is a significant change, incorporating a larger frame to deal with more powerful motors and subsequently larger propeller's, larger payload areas and even the capability of tilting the rotor assemblies for advanced hover modes.

| **Vehicle Version 2 Features** (Including all Version 1 Features) |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Increased Payload Size|
|Wireless Charging|
|Optional Tilt-Rotor|
|Optional Co-Axial Rotor|
|Forward-Looking Sonar x 3|
|Parachute Recovery System (Under Development)|

| **Vehicle Version 1 Features** |
|:-------------------------------|
|Terrain-Following|
|Foam Safety Ring (Not in Version 2)|
|Forward-Looking Sonar x 1|

# Specifications #

Sensors:  3-Axis Accelerometer, 3-Axis Gyroscope, 3-Axis Magnetometer (Razor 9DOF INU), Digital Compass, Altimeter, GPS, 5 Ultrasonic Sensors.

Power:  4 Brushless DC 200 Watt Motors, 2 Lithium-Ion 11.1V 5 Amp-Hours, 4 18A Electronic Speed Controllers, 5V and 3.3V Linear Voltage Regulators.

Control:  SoM Controller (Primary), Propeller Controller (Secondary), custom PCB.

Communications:  Xbee Radio for Command/Control, Video Transmitter, Wi-Fi (Field programming, tentative).

# Future Capabilities and Technologies #

## Recovery System ##

A Recovery System that allows the Vehicle to automatically deploy a parachute in case of an in-flight incident is being developed.  The parachute is released from the ejection of a rocket engine to allow the parachute to escape the potential entanglement of the rotor blades.  The GCS and RCU are capable of initiating the Recovery System, and the Vehicle is capable of initiating it automatically if any of the following conditions are met:
|Vehicle battery expectancy is very low|
|:-------------------------------------|
|Vehicle falling un-controllably|

Additionally, a flare option may be installed as well to facilitate location of Vehicle.

**Note:**  The Recovery System may not be installed in conjunction with the Safety System.

## Safety System ##

A Safety System that consists of a foam ring around the Vehicle is being developed.  This will assist in the user training of Operator's and when operating the Vehicle in indoor or other environments with obstacles.  The weight of the Safety System will be small in order for the Vehicle to operate effectively and not significantly change the operating parameters of its flight configuration.

**Note:**  The Safety System may not be installed in conjunction with the Recovery System.

## Test-Fixture Attachment System ##

A Test-Fixture Attachment System is being to developed to facilitate mechanical coupling of the Vehicle to the Test-Stand.  This will be a magnetic coupling so removal/installation of the Vehicle on the Test-Stand will be possible with no tools, and will be a negligible weight to the Vehicle so it may be left installed permanently.
