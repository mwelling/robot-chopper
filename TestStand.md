# Introduction #

The Test Stand is designed to support testing of different parameters of a flying vehicle in a controlled environment.  It is capable of continuous horizontal rotation, limited vertical travel, lift force measurement and can power the Vehicle through a 480W Power Supply connected to a slip ring on the base that doesn't limit the rotation of the Test Stand.

All Design Files were done using Alibre 3D Design, and are available through the SVN Server.

All materials for the Test Stand will be procurred locally and machined by Integrated Ideas and Technologies, a local Machine Shop.
